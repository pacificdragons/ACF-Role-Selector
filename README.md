# ACF - Role Selector Field

This plugin adds a user role selector to ACF, allowing you to select one or more user roles using a customizable field.

## Description

This plugin helps you out if you need to have the ability to select one or more user roles. Roles can be chosen with a select element (single or multiple choice), checkboxes or radio buttons. Roles can be returned as a role name or a role object.

You also have the option of specifying allowed roles. This lets you control the roles users are allowed to select.

# For Developers

The plugin allows you to specify the roles that can be selected but there is also a hook which allows for further changes. The `acfrsf/allowed_roles` filter allows you to modify the set of shown roles easily like so:

```
add_filter('acfrsf/allowed_roles', 'my_role_filter', 10, 2 );
function my_role_filter( $roles, $field ) {
    if( current_user_can( 'activate_plugins' ) ) {
        $roles = array(); // This will enable all roles
    }
    else {
        unset( $roles['administrator'] );
    }
    return $roles;
}
```
